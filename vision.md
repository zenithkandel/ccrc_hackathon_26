SAWARI
I have imagined sawari as a user guiding app which guides us people around the crowded city of Nepal by telling them about the bus routes in their way. Lets explain using an example. You are at your home, you now need to go to a job appointment or a friends home or anything. Lets take your home as point A and your friends home as point B. now you have some options which are either take a pathao ride which is a ride booking app which lets us to take bikes and taxies to the destination. Another option is go and ask hundreds of people about the way to go there.Yes, there is google maps but it doesnot show the route the public transportation uses. It just shows the driving route where there might or might not be public transportation services. There is where sawari comes in handy. Lets see how it works:

1. you enter your starting point (point A) 2. you enter your destination (point B) 3. sawari processing: a. analyzes the distance and the location b. searches for the bus stops and stations around point A c. searches for the bus stops and stations around point B d. checks if there are any public transportation going from the nearest bus station at point A to nearest bus station at point B e. if yes, i. it decides the bus stations and the route ii. it gives the walking direction from point A to bus station A iii. it shows which bus to ride (mahanagar, sajha, Nepal yatayat, araniko yatayat, etc…) along with their pictures for bus identification
   iv. it shows how much price to pay and what to say to the conductor to get off at the designated station v. after reaching the station B, it shows the walking direction from station B to point B f. if not, i. then it searches for the nearest bus station at point A from where the buses towards point B are available. ii. It also searches for the nearest bus station at point B from where the buses towards point A are available. iii. It gets both the routes of the buses and then calculates where the two routes meet and where the user should drop and change the bus using advanced math algorithms like Dijkstra. The app gives both the routes and then uses the complex algorithms to decide where should I get off and change the bus and then according to the algorithm’s output, it tells the user the idea.
   iv. In exchanging buses, when the user says that they have gotten off the first bus, it shows the picture and the name of the bus which they have to take from that point to get to the destination v. it shows which bus to ride (mahanagar, sajha, Nepal yatayat, araniko yatayat, etc…) along with their pictures for bus identification vi. it shows how much price to pay and what to say to the conductor to get off at the designated station vii. after reaching the station B, it shows the walking direction from station B to point B g. if somehow it fails to do the calculation, the app apolizes the user about its failure 4. after the ride is completed, the app asks the user for the review of the ride, the accuracy of the app and a suggestion box where they can add complains and suggestions for the app. 5. That’s all 😊
   EXTRA FEATURES AND UX ENHANCEMENTS 1. Fare calculation: a. Government assigned rate index + normal rate increment done b. For eg: if the government says its 13rs for the ride, the bus takes 15 rs. So accordingly we need to account for the calculation c. The app lets the user to select whether they are student or oldage person so that they can get discount. 2. Tourist help mode: a. What to say while getting on the bus b. What to say while getting off the bus c. Extra precautions to follow (pickpockets, haphazard driving, etc..) 3. Seamless bus switching mechanism: a. Accurate and useful bus switching mechanism. b. Not only bus but it accounts for micro bus as well as tuk tuks 4. Estimated time of wait in a bus stop:
   a. Calculate the route length of the bus b. Calculate the number of buses c. And as per the number of buses and the route length, calculate the bus frequency and display “a bus should come every 3 minutes in the station” 5. Proper rating, review, complaining, suggestion feature 6. Smart Emergency alerts issued by the administration: a. If due to any emergencies such as strikes or anything, if the route is disturbed then the admin can label it as disturbance felt and then the app will reroute 7. Community driven app: a. Users can suggest missing stops, wrong calculations, wrong routes, etc b. Agents leaderboard to motivate the users to contribute 8. Carbon emission calculation: a. Show in the app that if you use a routeao or other ride sharing app you do this much kg of carbon emissions and if you use public transport, you use this much kg of carbon emissions and you save the planet
   Data Collection Methodology - Sawari will be using agents are the main source of data collection. - Volunteers who will be referred to as “agents” will be collecting the data by travelling around the valley and then will be feeding it to our data servers and using it as the main dataset. - Every agents will be given an app which will have the following features: o Map places:  The agents can go to the places where the buses stop  They can then click a button in their app which will log their exact GPS coordinates at that time instance and they can label that place as the places name.  When the places name is labelled, the app will show similar entries which are already in the app and ask the agent to re check if the place they are trying to add already exists or not.  If two places have same name then they will be labelled by a following number. For example if I am going from north to south, the buses stop in one place by saying “charkapath wari” and another place by bname of “charkapath pari” which is totally direction based which changes depending on which direction you are going. Thus we label it as charkapath 1, charkapath 2, charkapath 3, charkapath 4, etc…  Every place can have a short description about 10 words. For example charkapath 1: near US embassy, charkapath 2: near hotel Shambhala, charkapath 3: near maharajgung bhatbhateni, charkapath 4: near Chirayu hospital.  This is how our app will have the index of all the bus stops in the valley.
