SAWARI
I have imagined sawari as a user guiding app which guides us people around the crowded city of Nepal by telling them about the bus routes in their way. Lets explain using an example. You are at your home, you now need to go to a job appointment or a friends home or anything. Lets take your home as point A and your friends home as point B. now you have some options which are either take a pathao ride which is a ride booking app which lets us to take bikes and taxies to the destination. Another option is go and ask hundreds of people about the way to go there.Yes, there is google maps but it doesnot show the route the public transportation uses. It just shows the driving route where there might or might not be public transportation services. There is where sawari comes in handy. Lets see how it works:
